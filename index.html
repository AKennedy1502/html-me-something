    <h1>Colorado Summer Vacation ~ August 2019</h1>

       <p id="intro">My husband and I spent our honeymoon in Colorado in 2012 
           and we wanted to introduce our six year old son, Riley, 
           to the beauty of "The Centennial State." In order to do this, we 
           went on a 10 day road trip during August 2019.</p>

      <p>We arrived in Denver after a long 10 hour drive and checked into 
          our bargain motel. We looked around for a close restaurant to 
          have dinner at. We love unique places that are kid friendly so 
          we were immediately drawn to a restaurant that offered food, 
          bowling, karoke and was housed in the 27-story former air traffic 
          control tower of the Stapleton International Airport. Punch Bowl 
          Social had taken over the closed tower and re-imagined it into a 
          fun and visually inspiring retro "eater-tainment" concept. </p>

        <p>A drive along the front range led us to Estes Park and the Aerial Tramway. 
            It has been open since 1955 and is one of the few free span trams in the 
            United States. We enjoyed a smooth and steady 3.5 minute ride up the 1,100 
            vertical feet to the top of Prospect Mountain. We bought peanuts at the 
            small ca&#769;fe at the top to feed to the resident chipmonks and enjoyed the 
            breathtaking views of Estes Park.</p>

        <p>We previously drove to Colorado Springs in 2012 just after they had 
            experienced the Waldo Canyon fire. In 2012, you could see blackened areas of 
            devastation from the highway. It was good to see the regrowth 
            and new construction in the same area this summer. We drove up 14,115 
            feet to the top of Pikes Peak and then enjoyed some special 
            high-elevation recipe donuts as we looked around.</p>

        <p>After the somewhat harrowing drive down Pikes Peak, we drove over 
            to the Garden of the Gods to see the amazing red sandstone formations.</p>

        <h2>South Dakota</h2>
        <p>With an extra day left on our vacation with no particular plans, we 
            decided to pack up a day early and take a longer route on the way home 
            in order to see some historical sites in South Dakota. We drove north through 
            Colorado, through the corner of Wyoming and then on to South Dakota. 
            We drove close enough to see the ongoing transformation of the Crazy 
            Horse Monument but we did not stop.</p>

        <p>We realized that the Sturgis motorcycle rally was happening when we saw 
            an unsual amount of motorcycles joining us on our drive to Keystone, SD, 
            to the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Riley was very excited to see 
            the monument because he had studied Abraham Lincoln 
            in his Kindergarten class. We finally got back into our car and 
            continued on our way.</p>

        <p>We stopped at a rest stop in Chamberlain, SD, and happened upon an amazing
             work of art. The breathtaking 50-foot statue is named "Dignity."</p>

        <h2>Home (Gladstone, MO)</h2>
        <p>Riley fell asleep in the car and we decided to just keep driving. We 
            arrived home at 3:30am, twenty hours after we started our journey home 
            from Colorado. What an amazing vacation!</p>
